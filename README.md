The initial descriptions of all use cases are posted.

PREP : 
Set up your ENV

# Install Prerequisites
### Have node.js installed, if you do not have it installed visit the  [official Node.js page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download it. 
We recommend downloading the version [v20.4.0](https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.4.0/)
### Have npm installed

### Possible errors
If you run into any problems during the `npm install` `npm start` steps.
It is likely due to the installed npm version, you might have to downgrade it. Fixes:
    
- use ```nvm``` (Node Version Manager), instruction for installation found [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating)
- run `nvm use`, it will try and use the version specified in the ```.nvmrc``` file, if the required version is not installed on your machine, it will provide you the steps required for downloading it (```nvm install v20.4.0```). After you downloaded it, run `nvm use` again
- now you can repeat the `npm install` `npm start` steps.

## An ode to the coming Hackathon.
In the heart of innovation's vibrant streak,</br>
Lies the UAE, where dreams dare to speak.</br>
A hackathon unfolds, a tech marvel fest,</br>
Where minds ignite, and ideas never rest.</br>

From sands to stars, their ambitions reach,</br>
In coding sprints, each solution they preach.</br>
UAE Innovation Week shines bright,</br>
A testament to their visionary light.</br>

Together they build, in unity they weave,</br>
A future where in endless possibilities, they believe.</br>
