## An ode to the coming Hackathon.
In the heart of innovation's vibrant streak,</br>
Lies the UAE, where dreams dare to speak.</br>
A hackathon unfolds, a tech marvel fest,</br>
Where minds ignite, and ideas never rest.</br>

From sands to stars, their ambitions reach,</br>
In coding sprints, each solution they preach.</br>
UAE Innovation Week shines bright,</br>
A testament to their visionary light.</br>

Together they build, in unity they weave,</br>
A future where in endless possibilities, they believe.</br>
