## Here is a poem as an ode to the coming Hackathon.
In the heart of innovation's vibrant streak,
Lies the UAE, where dreams dare to speak.
A hackathon unfolds, a tech marvel fest,
Where minds ignite, and ideas never rest.

From sands to stars, their ambitions reach,
In coding sprints, each solution they preach.
UAE Innovation Week shines bright,
A testament to their visionary light.

Together they build, in unity they weave,
A future where in endless possibilities, they believe.
